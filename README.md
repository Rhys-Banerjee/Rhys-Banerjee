# Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Rhys ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth-year student at Duke University studying Computer Science, minoring in mathematics, and pursuing a concentration in AI and Machine Learning. I've worked multiple internships as a software engineer, and this is where you can find some of my personal projects.

- :computer: I'm interested in video game programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software development.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I'm currently learning about database design.
- :musical_keyboard: For fun I like to draw cartoons in Clip Studio Paint and create animations in Adobe Flash CS6! I'm also a big fan of music, and I play the piano in my spare time.
- ðŸ˜„ My name is pronounced "Reese Ban-ur-jee".

## My Projects
Some of my projects have to relate to gaming. I'm currently interested in the Godot video game engine because of its lightweight design and open-source development. 

### [Red Dash Frenzy](https://github.com/Rhys-Banerjee/RedDashFrenzy) :video_game:
This was my first game developed with Godot. It's simple by design and challeges the player to complete difficult levels *without* the ability to jump. It's playable on [Itch.io](https://riceware.itch.io/red-dash-frenzy) as a browser-based game as well.

### [Bowling Bash](https://github.com/Rhys-Banerjee/BowlingBash) :bowling:
This is my next Godot game currently in progress. Once complete, it will be a momentum-based game, challenging players to speedrun numerous obstacle courses with a limited amount of time. I plan to release the game on Itch.io upon completion.

### [FlappyAI](https://github.com/Rhys-Banerjee/FlappyAI) :computer:
This is a simple demonstration of NEAT AI which uses a PyGame-based recreation of the popular game, Flappy Bird, to create perfect gameplay. Watching the algorithm in effect is really mesmerizing to watch!
