## My Projects
Some of my projects have to relate to gaming. I'm currently interested in the Godot video game engine because of its lightweight design and open-source development. 

### [Red Dash Frenzy](https://github.com/Rhys-Banerjee/RedDashFrenzy) :video_game:
This was my first game developed with Godot. It's simple by design and challenges the player to complete difficult levels *without* the ability to jump. It's playable on [Itch.io](https://riceware.itch.io/red-dash-frenzy) as a browser-based game as well.

### [Bowling Bash](https://github.com/Rhys-Banerjee/BowlingBash) :bowling:
This is my next Godot game currently in progress. Once complete, it will be a momentum-based game, challenging players to speedrun numerous obstacle courses with a limited amount of time. I plan to release the game on Itch.io upon completion.

### [FlappyAI](https://github.com/Rhys-Banerjee/FlappyAI) :computer:
This is a simple demonstration of the NEAT algorithm which uses a PyGame-based recreation of the popular game, Flappy Bird, to create perfect gameplay. Seeing the algorithm in effect is really mesmerizing to watch!
